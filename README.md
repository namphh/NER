NER with BERT
NER dataset to recognize the name entity from the sentences
Name-entity recognition (NER) is also referred to as entity identification, entity chunking, and entity extraction. NER is the component of information extraction that aims to identify and categorize named entities within unstructured text. NER involves the identification of key information in the text and classification into a set of predefined categories. An entity is the thing that is consistently talked about or refer to in the text, such as person names, organizations, locations, time expressions, quantities, percentages and more predefined categories.
